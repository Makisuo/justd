## Basic
A slide-in overlay for extra content or options, anchored to the screen edge for quick access! Originally coded by **Devon Govett**. Check out his [tweet](https://x.com/devongovett/status/1674470185783402496) for more details. Want to improve it, like making the drawer's height adapt to the content? Feel free to drop a [PR](https://github.com/justdlabs/justd).

## Installation
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true }} items={['drawer']}/>

## Composed Components
<Composed components={['button']}/>

## Manual Installation
<Installation options={{ isManual: true }} items={['react-aria-components', 'vaul']}/>

## Anatomy
<Anatomy show='drawer-anatomy'/>

## Controlled
To manually control the drawer's state, use the `isOpen` prop. When `isOpen` is set to `true`, the drawer opens; when it's `false`, the drawer closes.
<How toUse="overlays/drawer/drawer-controlled-demo" />

## Positioning
You can set the direction of the drawer to either `bottom`, `top`, `left`, or `right`.

## Hide Notch
You can hide the notch of the drawer by setting the `hideNotch` prop to `true`.
<How toUse="overlays/drawer/drawer-hide-notch-demo" />

## Centered
By default, the drawer is centered, but you can disable this by setting the `isCentered` prop to `false`. This is useful when you need the drawer to align differently.
<Note>Note that the `isCentered` prop only applies when the `side` is set to `bottom` or `top`. TypeScript will throw an error if used with `left` or `right`.</Note>

## Props
There are several props available to customize the drawer. The `side` prop, originally called `direction` in Vaul, was renamed to align with Justdâ€™s consistent naming convention. Likewise, `open` was renamed to `isOpen` for the same reason, ensuring uniformity across the API.
| Props        | Default  |
|--------------|----------|
| `side`       | `bottom` |
| `isOpen`     | -        |
| `hideNotch`  | `false`  |
| `isCentered` | `true`   |
