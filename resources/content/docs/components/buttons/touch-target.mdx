## Basic
There’s not much to see here directly, but you can check out related components like [Button](/docs/components/buttons/button), [Link](/docs/components/navigation/link), and others.

<Note>
  Heads up: when you incorporate components such as **button**, **dialog**, or **menu**, and other components that use the `TouchTarget` component, the touch target functionality is included automatically. No separate installation required.
</Note>

## Installation
<InstallCommand isAdd items={['touch-target']} />

## Manual Installation
<SourceCode toShow={['touch-target']} />

## Why Use Touch Target?
This component is designed to appear on touch screen devices. If you watched Adam Wathan’s talk at [Laracon](https://youtu.be/MrzrSFbxW7M?t=1959), you’ll understand its importance. For simplicity, we use this component to enhance button accessibility on touch devices.
