## Responsive
Grid's responsiveness is a breeze, with the ability to define your columns and gaps for any screen size. Whether you're designing for mobile, tablet, or desktop, Grid ensures that your content looks great on all devices.

<Note intent="primary">
  This grid ain't got no default variants, so if you don't set an initial value, it's a big fat nothing. When you're
  setting up a responsive prop like `sm` or `md`, make sure to slap an initial value for the breakpoint.

## Gaps
Grid's gaps are configurable, allowing you to define the space between each item. Whether you're designing for mobile, tablet, or desktop, Grid ensures that your content looks great on all devices.

## Gaps X and Y
Sometimes you need make diffrent gaps for the `x` and `y` axis. Grid's `gapX` and `gapY` props allow you to do just that.

## Debugging
Sometimes you need to know what's going on in your grid. Grid has a `debug` prop that will add a border around each item.

## Grid Item
Grid Item is the component that makes up the grid. It's a wrapper around the `ListBoxItem` component from `react-aria-components`. Grid Item has all the same props as `ListBoxItem`, but with a few extra props to help you define column and row spans.

I use that vibe on the [Components](/components) page, where you can catch the link to the component's docs. What's the next step?

## Props
Aight, just a heads up, all them props got that responsive mojo. You can tweak the prop for each breakpoint like a boss.
