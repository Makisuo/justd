## Using Justd CLI
Just run init command to start a new project:
<Installation command='npx justd-cli@latest init' />
With that command, Justd will ask you a few questions about your project.
```
✔ No setup project detected. Do you want to start a new project? (Y/n) Yes
✔ What language do you want to use? Typescript
? Which framework do you want to use?
❯ Laravel
  Next.js
  Remix
  Vite
```

## Laravel Installer
If you prefer the Laravel Installer, you can set up Justd by running the following command:
<Installation command='laravel new app --using=justd/laravel'/>

## Composer
Alternatively, if you're using Composer, install Justd with the command below:
<Installation command='composer create-project justd/laravel app'/>

Once installed, you can start adding components to your project by running:
<Installation command='npx justd-cli@latest add table'/>

## Source Code
