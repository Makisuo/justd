---

## Installation
Start a new project with the following command:
<Installation command='npx create-tsrouter-app@latest app --template file-router --tailwind' />

Next, initialize Justd in your project:
<Installation command='npx justd-cli@latest init --force' />

You'll be asked a few setup questions. For example, here we specify a custom CSS location:
```
✔ Initializing.
✔ Components folder: src/components
✔ Utils folder: src/utils
✔ Where would you like to place the CSS file? src/styles.css
✔ Pick your desired base gray: zinc
✔ Installing dependencies.
✔ Configuring.
✔ UI folder created at `src/components/ui`
✔ Primitive file saved to `src/components/ui/primitive.tsx`
✔ Theme Provider file saved to `"src/components/theme-provider.ts"`
✔ Providers file saved to `"src/components/providers.tsx"`
✔ Configuration saved to `justd.json`
✔ Installation complete.
```

## Adding Components
Add Justd components to your project with the following command:
<Installation command='npx justd-cli@latest add text-field button menu' />
