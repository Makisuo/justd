## Installation via CLI
Before executing the command, ensure that **tailwind** is installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for installation.

<Note intent='info'>
  Running this command will overwrite your **main css** file. It is recommended to use this in a
  **new project** rather than an existing one to avoid manual file additions.
</Note>

### Initial Setup
Begin by executing this command:

<Installation options={{ isInit: true }} items={['initial setup']} />

When you're run this command, it will ask a couple of questions. Like where's your components folder, utils, your main css file, and lastly is the theme you want like so:
```bash
✔ Initializing.
? Components folder: src/components
? Utils folder: src/utils
? Where would you like to place the CSS file? src/app/globals.css
? Select a base gray: (Use arrow keys)
❯ zinc
  gray
  slate
  neutral
  stone
```
If it's all good, you will see the following:
```bash
Not sure what to do next?
Visit our documentation at: https://getjustd.com

Now try to add some components to your project
by running: npx justd-cli@latest add

      _           _      _
     | |_   _ ___| |_ __| |
  _  | | | | / __| __/ _` |
 | |_| | |_| \__ \ || (_| |
  \___/ \__,_|___/\__\__,_|
```

### Add Components
Next, use `add [component-name]` to include a specific component in your project. This allows for selective installation without the need for a full setup. If you need a file-trigger or even a button, this command facilitates that. Install only what you need, or refer to the documentation to manually include components. Here's how to add a `combo-box`:
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['combo-box']} />

This command will ensure all necessary components are installed:
```bash
✔ Checking.
✔ Installing dependencies.
✔ Created 7 files:
  - src/components/ui/combo-box.tsx
  - src/components/ui/field.tsx
  - src/components/ui/list-box.tsx
  - src/components/ui/dropdown.tsx
  - src/components/ui/popover.tsx
  - src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
  - src/components/ui/button.tsx
```

Sometimes, you may want to add components individually, such as `select` and `text-field`. You can easily do this by using the following command:
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['select', 'text-field']} />
If you need to include grouped components, refer to the documentation which organizes related components under a single namespace, such as collections, overlays, and forms. This allows you to add them all at once, like so:

<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['overlays']} />
Using this command, you will install all components under the overlays namespace.
```bash
✓ button created
✓ dialog created
✓ modal created
✓ sheet created
✓ drawer created
✓ popover created
✓ tooltip created
```

### Override
You can override the existing components by using the `-o` flag. This will overwrite the existing files with the new ones.
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['button modal -o']} />

### Select and Add Components
You might prefer to select the components you want to include by adding them without specifying any items. Just use the following command to add components:
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['']} />
This command will present a list of available components, which you can navigate and select using the arrow keys and spacebar.
```bash
? Select components to add: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to
  proceed)
  ◯ dropdown
  ◯ dialog
  ◯ field
  ◯ forms
  ◯ collections
  ◯ date-and-time
  ```

### Diff
You can see the differences between your current setup and the new one by using the following command:

<Installation options={{isExecutor: true}} command='npx justd-cli@latest diff' items={['']} />

You can see this [tweet](https://x.com/irsyadadl/status/1823355475020402781) if you're not sure.

You can also doing a diff to specific components by using the following command:
<Installation command='npx justd-cli@latest diff multiple-select menu modal' items={['']}/>

## Starter Kit
I offer two starter kits, one for Next.js and one for Laravel. Choose the one that suits your project needs.

<Note intent='info'>
  If you have other starter kits, such as Remix or Vite, consider submitting a
  [PR](https://github.com/justdlabs/next.js/issues/new) to expand our list.
</Note>

Here’s a swagged-out version of what you got:

### Laravel
First up, make sure you got [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) chillin' on your system. Then, hit this
command to spin up a fresh project:
<Installation command='composer create-project justd/laravel app' items={['']}/>
Jump into your new crib with `cd app`, then install all the goods with `npm i && npm run dev`. Fire up your
server with `php artisan serve`, and boom—you’re ready to roll.

### Next.js
Get on that Just D hype with the [Next.js Starter Kit](https://next.getjustd.com/). This bad boy is pre-loaded and
ready to go. Kick off a new project with:
<Installation command='npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/justdlabs/next.js project-name' items={['']}/>

### Remix
Remix caught your eye? Kick things off with the [Remix Starter Kit](https://remix.getjustd.com/), crafted by [José
Miguel](https://github.com/m1guer). It’s like Next.js but with that Remix spin. Grab the repo here:
[justdlabs/remix](https://github.com/justdlabs/remix). To get started, run the following command:
<Installation command='npx create-remix@latest --template justdlabs/remix' items={['']}/>

### Astro
This starter is already in production, and you can check it out [here](https://astro.getjustd.com/). The repository is
available [here](https://github.com/justdlabs/astro). To get started, run the following command:
<Installation command='npm create astro@latest -- --template justdlabs/astro' items={['']}/>


## Manual Installation
To begin setting up the design system, start by installing these packages:

<Installation options={{isManual: true}} items={['react-aria-components', 'tailwindcss-react-aria-components']}/>

Next, add Tailwind Variant, Tailwind Merge, and clsx for utility functions:

<Installation options={{isManual: true}} items={['tailwind-variants', 'tailwind-merge', 'clsx']} />

Following that, include the animation package for managing animations and Paranoid for icons:

<Installation options={{isManual: true}} items={['justd-icons', 'tailwindcss-animate']} />

### Style and Primitive
  After installing the required packages, you can copy the CSS below into your global CSS file and move the primitives to your UI folder. Primitives serve as utilities for managing states, including `focusRing`, `focusStyles`, and `focusButtonStyles`. Additionally, there’s a hook called `useMediaQuery` and a function named `composeTailwindRenderProps`. Every component in Justd relies on helpers from this file, so it’s essential to include it!

<EditorText
  source={{
    'app/globals.css': 'docs/installation/main.css',
    'ui/primitive.tsx': 'ui/primitive',
  }} />

  ### Classes / CN
  By default, components are saved in the `components/ui` folder of your project. These components include essential
  functions like `cn` for className handling and `composeTailwindRenderProps`. However, these functions are not
  compatible with server components. If you need to use `cn` outside of the typical environment, you should isolate it
  in a separate file like this:

  ```ts title="utils/classes.ts"
import { type ClassValue, cnBase } from "tailwind-variants"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export const cn = (...inputs: ClassValue[]): string => twMerge(cnBase(...inputs))
```

### Simple Import
Indeed, it's efficient because the `index.ts` file in your UI folder serves as a hub. Even if the button and badge
components are in separate files, you can import them together easily. First, create a `ui/index.ts` file:
  ```ts title="ui/index.ts"
  export * from "./primitive";
  export * from "./sidebar";
  export * from "./navbar";
  export * from "./tree";
  export * from "./table";
  export * from "./text-field";
  export * from "./button";
  export * from "./card";
  // ...
  ```

So, here's the scoop: your UI folder contains an `index.ts` file, right? This file consolidates all your components for
straightforward access. Simply tell TypeScript where to find it and import them as needed, hassle-free!
<EditorText
  source={{
    'component.tsx': 'docs/installation/component.docs',
    'tsconfig.json': 'docs/installation/not-tsconfig.json',
  }} />

If you're using src folder, you can use the following config:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "ui": ["./src/components/ui"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Fonts
This is is currently using the [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/). If you want to use a different font, you can define your font-family in your js or css file.

### Stylesheet
When you're working with a stylesheet, you can define your `@font-face` in your css file.

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url("InterVariable.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

### Next.js
If you're using Next.js, you don't event need css files. Just define your font in your layout file.

```
import localFont from 'next/font/local'

const fontSans = localFont({
  src: [{path: './fonts/Inter.woff2'}],
  variable: '--font-sans'
})
```

Then, apply the `fontSans` to the `body` tag like this:

```tsx
<body
  className={`font-sans antialiased ${fontSans.variable}`}
/>
```

Then, you can use the variable in your main css file like this:

```css
@theme {
  --font-sans: var(--font-sans), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji",
  "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji";
  --font-mono: var(--font-mono), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji",
  "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji";

  // Your other variables
}
```

For more information, refer to the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family#customizing-the-default-font) and [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts).

## InteliSense
If you want your development environment to be more intelligent, you can follow instructions here at [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/getting-started#intellisense-setup-optional).

## Dark Mode
Justd supports dark mode out of the box. Every framework has its own way of implementing dark mode. So you better check the docs list below:
