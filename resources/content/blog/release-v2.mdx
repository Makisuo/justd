## What's New
- Upgrade to Tailwind v4.
- With Tailwind v4 adopting OKLCH for colors, we've aligned our format to match.
- Remove TRAC
- Redesign every component
- Remove color `accent-subtle`, `accent-subtle-fg`, `tertiary`, `tertiary-fg`
- Add color `sidebar`, `sidebar-fg`, `navbar`, `navbar-fg`.
- Add color for charts `chart-1`, `chart-2`, `chart-3`, `chart-4`, `chart-5`
- Calendar and Range Calendar now by default use `rounded-lg` instead of `rounded-full`
- Some existing components, such as [Chart](/docs/components/charts/setup), [Sidebar](/docs/components/layouts/sidebar), [Disclosure](/docs/components/navigation/disclosure), and [TagGroup](/docs/components/collections/tag-group), no longer utilize the [Compound Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/compound-pattern/).
- Add new page [Blocks](/blocks)
- Grid move to Alpha
- Grid remove Collections
- `cn()` now is moved to `utils/classes.ts` to more consistent with the rest of the components.
- Some components rewrite to be better including:
  - Sidebar
  - Disclosure
  - Navbar
  - Button
  - Field
