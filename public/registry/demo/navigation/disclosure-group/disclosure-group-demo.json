It's\n          an affordable option, but may have limitations on performance and customization.\n        </DisclosurePanel>\n      </Disclosure>\n      <Disclosure id={4}>\n        <DisclosureTrigger>What is dedicated hosting?</DisclosureTrigger>\n        <DisclosurePanel>\n          Dedicated hosting means your website is hosted on a single server exclusively reserved for your site. This\n          provides maximum performance and customization, but at a higher cost.\n        </DisclosurePanel>\n      </Disclosure>\n    </DisclosureGroup>\n  )\n}\n"
